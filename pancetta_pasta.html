    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pancetta pasta is an Italian pasta dish flavored with rich, salty pancetta. Pancetta is seasoned, salt-cured meat cut from the pork belly (the pig’s underside). Pancetta is light pink with a dense, silky texture and nutty flavor. You’ll find it sold in thin slices in Italy and most oftenly cubed in the United States.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces dried pasta (such as fettucini, penne, linguine, or rigatoni)</li>
        <li>4 ounces pancetta, cubed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup Parmesan or pecorino cheese, grated</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat and salt the water.</li>
        <li>While the water is coming to a boil, heat a large skillet on the stove over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the cubed pancetta to the skillet and sauté until crispy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta to the boiling, salted water and cook for 2 minutes less than the package directions</li>
        <li>While the pasta cooks, remove the crispy pancetta from the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil to the rendered pork fat.</li>
        <li>Add the minced shallot and minced garlic to the pan and sauté for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat under the skillet to low heat and add the crispy pancetta, cheese, and heavy cream.</li>
        <li>Using tongs, transfer the al dente pasta from the large pot to the skillet with the sauce. Some pasta water will get into the sauce.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat the medium heat and bring the sauce to a simmer while tossing the pasta.</li>
        <li>Season the pasta with salt, pepper, and optional red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce is thick, and the pasta fully cooked, serve the pasta hot and garnish with extra grated cheese.</li>
    </ol>
