    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pumpkin banana bread is a quick bread that combines mashed banana, pumpkin purée, flour, salt, baking soda, and sugar. Quick bread is a bread that uses a chemical leavening agent, such as baking powder or baking soda, rather than yeast to rise. Adding pumpkin purée and pumpkin pie spices, including cinnamon and nutmeg, makes this loaf-pan bread a perfect fall treat. You can customize pumpkin banana bread with mix-ins like chocolate chips and cranberries.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup white whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1¼ teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large or 3 medium bananas, ripe</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>¼ cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup coconut sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg white</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>⅓ can of pumpkin pie filling</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>⅛ cup of dried cranberries,<strong><em>optional</em></strong> </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Line a 9-inch by 5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper and coat it with baking spray or vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized mixing bowl, use a fork to gently whisk together the flours, baking soda, spices, and salt.</li>
        <li>Peel the bananas and mash them in a medium bowl with your hands or a masher until there are no hard spots.</li>
        <li>In a separate, large bowl, beat the butter and sugars until they get creamy.</li>
        <li>Then, add in the wet ingredients (egg white, egg, bananas, pumpkin, and vanilla). Beat until thick.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the large bowl and beat slowly until well combined. You can add cranberries.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 55 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan and insert a toothpick into the bread. If the toothpick comes out clean, it is ready. If not, bake it for another five minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool the bread on a wire rack and serve once no longer hot.</li>
    </ol>
